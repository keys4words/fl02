                <p>The original Bank of New York was founded in 1784 by Alexander Hamilton and chartered in 1791. It was instrumental in securing the first loan obtained by the United States. Other loans by the bank contributed to the construction of the Erie Canal and the New York City subway system. From the 1920s to the ’60s it merged with a number of other banks, and in 1968 the Bank of New York, Inc., was incorporated as the holding company for the various subsidiaries, including the Bank of New York, much enlarged. In 1969 the holding company assumed the current name. Thereafter it acquired several banking, financial, and investment firms, mostly in New York state but also elsewhere in the United States and overseas. The vigorous expansion was marked especially by the 1988 takeover of the giant Irving Bank Corporation (founded 1851).</p>
                <p>The Bank of New York oversees commercial banking and trust and investment services for banks, corporations, institutions, and high-net-worth individuals. Through an arrangement with JPMorgan Chase in 2006, the Bank of New York swapped its retail and middle-market banking business for JPMorgan Chase’s corporate trust business, thereby concentrating its focus on securities processing and asset management. In the same year, the Bank of New York agreed to acquire the Mellon Financial Corporation of Pittsburgh.</p>

                <p class="mt-3">Mellon Financial Corporation, American bank holding company whose principal subsidiary, Mellon Bank, has been one of the largest regional banks in the country. Its headquarters are in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p>
                <p>The original bank, T. Mellon and Sons Bank, was founded in 1869 by Thomas Mellon (1813–1908), a native of Ireland. One of his four sons, Andrew W. Mellon (1855–1937), joined the business in 1874 and proved so capable that the elder Mellon transferred the bank’s ownership to him in 1882. With the bank as the cornerstone of his financial empire, Andrew Mellon (later treasury secretary in the Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover administrations) helped establish Pittsburgh’s leading industrial companies, including the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) and Gulf Oil Company. In 1902 the bank was reorganized as Mellon National Bank and became a subsidiary of Andrew Mellon’s Union Trust Company. The two companies merged completely in 1946 to become Mellon National Bank and Trust Company. Andrew’s younger brother Richard B. Mellon and the latter’s son Richard K. Mellon successively headed the bank until 1967. The holding company was formed in 1972 and took the name Mellon Bank Corporation in 1984.</p>
